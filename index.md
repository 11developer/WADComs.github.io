WADComs is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of Unix/Windows offensive tools and their respective commands. 

If you hate constantly looking up the right command to use against a Windows or Active Directory enfironment (like me), this project should help ease the pain a bit. Just select what information you currently have related to the Windows machine (passwords, usernames, services, etc.), and it will display a list of tools you can try against the machine, along with a template command for easy copy/pasting. See the full list of [filters](/functions/).

This project was inspired by [GTFOBins][GTFOBins] and [LOLBAS][LOLBAS]. 

I'm hoping to make WADComs a [collaborative project][collaborative], so please feel free to [contribute][contribute] your commands.
